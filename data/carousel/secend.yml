    We invite children and their parents/guardians every Saturday from 9:30 AM to 1:30 PM. We offer high-quality education thanks to our qualified teaching staff. We teach the Polish language with elements of history and geography. Additionally, we conduct art classes where students have the opportunity to dance, sing, paint, or draw. The lessons are original, engaging, and unique. Our students are our top priority, which is why we care about their overall intellectual development and nurture them in a Christian spirit.
